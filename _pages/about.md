I'm a second year Ph.D. student from [Faculty of Engineering and IT](https://eng.unimelb.edu.au/), [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/). My research interest includes hypothesis testing, machine learning, semi-supervised learning and representation learning.

I'm very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Feng Liu](https://fengliu90.github.io/index.html) of [Trustworthy Machine Learning and Reasoning Group](https://github.com/tmlr-group) (Melbourne).
